Implemented k-nearest neighbour algorithm on iris flowes dataset.
make 70% as train data and remaining 30% data is uses as test data.
Now using knn algorithm we pick a datapoint and we predict wheater it is of type setosa, or varginica, or versicolor.now we compare predicted values and actual values and get it's accuracy.
